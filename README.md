The competition aims to encourage participants to use quantitative methods and machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices based on past data. The competition provides a large dataset consisting of historical stock prices, financial ratios, and news sentiment scores, which participants can use to develop their models. Participants will be ranked based on the accuracy of their predictions on a hidden test set.
